---

In this example a typical Mars workflow for the analysis of smFRET (single-molecule FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer)<sup>[1](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1208), [2](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.58.2.719), [3](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.93.13.6264)</sup> datasets is discussed. This popular single-molecule technique is used extensively by many labs to investigate the behavior of bio-macromolecules like proteins, RNA, and DNA on a single-molecule level. Among numerous interesting and revealing studies, some examples of important processes that have been studied in this way are: the structural organization of bacterial RNA polymerase <sup>[4](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0092-8674(02)00667-0)</sup>, protein-protein complex formation in neurotransmission pathways <sup>[5](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.1763)</sup>, dynamics of multi-domain proteins like Hsp90 in solution <sup>[6](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4081)</sup>, protein folding upon ligand interaction <sup>[7](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.SBI.2007.12.003)</sup>, and studies of the cAMP/PKA pathways <sup>[8](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.BBRC.2017.04.097)</sup>.

Mars is very well equipped to be used to analyse the data gathered in such studies. It offers a highly effective, easy to use, well documented, and powerful open source alternative to home-built software currently used by some labs and focusses on reproducibility and transparency of the analysis process. To showcase its applicability to analyse smFRET datasets, in this example, the data of the benchmark study published by Hellenkamp *et al.* <sup>[9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0085-0)</sup> is analysed and compared. We show the typical pathway one can follow to analyse the data and find the FRET values E and S from this dataset.

#### <a name="design"></a> The FRET Sample Design and Mars Analysis Process

**Sample Design**  
In the experiment as designed by Hellenkamp *et al.* <sup>[9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0085-0)</sup> the distance between two fluorophores (a donor and an acceptor) on a DNA molecule is probed. Two different samples (figure 1: 1-lo and 1-mid) are measured with a different interfluorophore distance as indicated in the figure. Since the FRET efficiency (E) is inversely correlated to the distance between the fluorophores, a different E value is to be expected for both molecules. The fluorescence of both samples was measured using both TIRF and confocal single-molecule fluorescence set-ups after which the FRET parameters E and S were determined. In this example, the 1-lo dataset recorded on a TIRF microscope set-up will be analysed. The raw dataset can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/1249497#.YMccli0RrGI). More information on the data acquirement and sample specifics can be found in the publication by Hellenkamp *et al.*<sup>[9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0085-0)</sup>

The red sphere (left side DNA molecule) represents the acceptor fluorophore, in this case Atto647N, and the green sphere (right side DNA molecule) represents the donor fluorophore, in this case Atto550. In this example the analysis of the 1-lo dataset is discussed. In the final paragraph of this example results from the 1-mid dataset are discussed as well. <sup>[9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0085-0)</sup>
</div>

**The Analysis Procedure**  
The analysis of an smFRET dataset consists of a number of typical steps: (figure 2)
- Data recording: recording of the fluorescent emission signal both upon acceptor excitation (figure 2, C=0) and donor excitation (C=1) over time.
- Data analysis: starting by the extraction of intensity vs. time traces by means of peak integration followed by the application of several correction factors accounting for background differences, signal leakage, direct excitation effects and detection factors.
- Data interpretation: calculation of the FRET efficiency (E) and stoichiometry (S) for each molecule followed by the identification of the ensemble average E and S values for the population.

For more in-depth information on the analysis procedure and accompanying formulae justification the reader is kindly referred to the study published by Hellenkamp *et al.* <sup>[9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0085-0)</sup>

**Dataset Characteristics**  
The data as provided by Hellenkamp *et al.* <sup>[9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0085-0)</sup> was recorded with a TIRF microscope setup equipped with dual view collection. The detection area of the camera is split in half, each half displaying the signal after a different wavelength filter. In this way emission can be measured for two wavelengths at the same time and signal correlation is possible. In practise, for this dataset, this means that red emission is collected and shown on the left half, and the green emission on the right half of the window (figure 3). The excitation color alternates between red (C=0) and green (C=1) such that the different channels and split orientation give the peak intensities as denoted below each half by I<sub>emission|excitation</sub>. These intensities are integrated during analysis and after correction lead to the final E and S values.

**The Mars Workflow**  
The previously introduced analysis steps can be implemented in Mars directly. Figure 4 shows the specific steps and tools that are used in the analysis. [Documentation](https://duderstadt-lab.github.io/mars-docs/docs/) is available for each Mars tool specifically.
In short, first the video format is converted to contain channel information (excitation color, C=0, 1). Next, peaks are identified and correlated with the other half of the split view using the ROI transformation tool. The molecule integrator tool, subsequently, yields the peak intensity values vs. time for each peak and leads to the generation of three archives for the video: a FRET archive (peaks with both donor and acceptor emission), an acceptor only archive (AO, peaks with acceptor emission only), and a donor only archive (DO, peaks with donor emission only). These are tagged accordingly and merged into one archive. A normalization is carried out to correlate the donor and acceptor emission signals related to their beam profiles. Next, the kinetic change point (KCP) analysis and various data correction steps yield corrected intensity values to calculate E and S values of each molecule. A final plot with a Gaussian distribution fit to find the population center is then made using Python.

#### <a name="1"></a> Data preparation
**Opening and Converting the Video**  
First, [download](https://zenodo.org/record/1249497) the dataset from Hellenkamp *et al.*<sup>[9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0085-0)</sup>. Scroll down on the linked page and download the files named: '1_lo_TIFF.zip', '1_med_TIFF.zip' & 'Calibration_Files_for_TIFFs.zip'.
To prepare the video for easy analysis, turn SciFIO on in Fiji (Edit>Options>ImageJ2 tick the box) and open the first video (FSII1a_g30r84t200_0.tif) located in the '1_lo_TIFF.zip' folder. The original video does not contain specific channel information but simply displays the results of the different excitation colors in an alternating fashion. To convert the video to have channel information, run [script 1](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials/blob/master/Example_pipelines/FRET/Follow%20along%20example/Script1_convert%20video%20to%20dual%20channel.groovy). For information on how to run a script in Fiji please read [this tutorial](https://duderstadt-lab.github.io/mars-docs/tutorials/scripting/introduction-to-groovy-scripting/). If the script ran correctly, a new window should have opened showing a video with the channels represented in red and green.


**Calculation of the Affine2D Matrix**  
Next, to prepare for the data analysis, an Affine2D conversion matrix needs to be calculated. This matrix is used to correlate the peak position as found on one half of the split view to the corresponding position on the other half of the split view. More information about this calculation can be found in the [Affine2D tutorial](https://duderstadt-lab.github.io/mars-docs/tutorials/affine2D/HowToCalculateAffine2D/). Either follow along in the next steps to calculate the matrix or use the result from the calculation as provided in the table below.

To calculate the Affine2D matrix open the file ['calib20140402_0.tif'](https://zenodo.org/record/1249497) from the calibration folder 'Calibration_Files_for_TIFFs.zip'. This file shows a recording of a bead sample that fluoresces in multiple colors upon excitation with a wide variety of wavelengths. In this way, matching of the positions in both halves of the split view is possible. To do so, select a time point of choice and duplicate the frame twice (Image>Duplicate). This will create two images of the video at the same time point. Rename the images 'left' and 'right' and in each image black out the respective halve of the view by selecting that region with the square ROI tool and pressing delete. This will result in a set of images resembling the ones in the screenshot below.

<div style="text-align: center">
<img align='center' src='{{site.baseurl}}/examples/img/fret/img1.png' width='450'></div>

Next, open the registration tool (Plugins>Registration>Descriptor-based registration (2d/3d)) and select 'left' as the first image, 'right' as the second. Press OK and supply the settings as shown below in the next dialoge. After pressing OK, adjust the sigma and threshold values accordingly such that the peaks in the image are identified and press done. Use the default Gaussian fit parameters in the next window and press OK. This should open both an image displaying the overlap as well as a log window that displays the actual Affine2D matrix. Save the values of this matrix into a text document.

<div style="text-align: center">
<img align='center' src='{{site.baseurl}}/examples/img/fret/img3.png' width='450'></div>

The following values were found: (note that matrices calculated at a different T or with different settings can result in slightly different values)

|                 | Left to Right matrix     |
| :-------------  | :------------- |
| m<sub>00</sub>             | 0.986          |
| m<sub>01</sub>             | 0              |
| m<sub>02</sub>             | 268.639        |
| m<sub>10</sub>             | 0              |
| m<sub>11</sub>             | 0.993          |
| m<sub>12</sub>             | 1.170          |

#### <a name="3"></a> Localization of Peaks and Intensity vs. T traces
To calculate all FRET parameters and correction factors three different populations in the sample are of interest: the acceptor only (AO) population, the donor only (DO) population and the FRET population. To facilitate easy data analysis an archive is created for each of these populations separately. These are then later on merged together while retaining information on to which population the identified molecule belongs, information that is required to do the correction factor calculations.

All three archives are created following the same workflow: peak identification, ROI transformation to the other halve of the split view, ROI filtering and finally molecule integration to obtain intensity vs. T traces in an Archive. Below, the workflow to create the FRET archive is shown accompanied by screenshots. Please reference table 2 to repeat the archive creation also for the AO and DO archives. Alternatively, these archives can be downloaded from the [repository](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials/tree/master/Example_pipelines/FRET/Follow%20along%20example).

##### The FRET Archive
**1. Identify the red peaks in the red channel (C=0, left)**  
First, for a better fit performance, do a z-projection of the first 10 frames yielding an average image (Fiji>image>stacks>Z project...). Use  this image to find the coordinates of the peaks.
To find the peaks in the left part of the split view in the red channel first select this part of the screen with the box ROI tool and open the Peak Finder (Plugins>Mars>Image>Peak Finder). Apply the settings as shown below and check if the peaks are identified correctly by pressing the preview button. If the correct settings are applied the peaks should have an identification marker (circle or point) on them. Press ok to apply the settings and add the ROIs of the identified peaks to the ROI manager. The ROI manager will open and will display the peaks listed by their UID in the manager.

<img align='center' src='{{site.baseurl}}/examples/img/fret/img5.png' width='450'></div>

**2. Transform  the ROIs to the right part of the split view**  
Next, transform the coordinates (ROIs) of the peaks that were just identified to match the right part of the split view. In this way, in the next analysis step, integration of the peak intensity is possible at both emission wavelengths at the same time. Transform the ROIs to the right part of the split view by using the Transform ROI tool (Plugins>Mars>ROI>Transform ROIs). Use the Affine2D matrix (left to right) as calculated before (see table 1). Provide the split view dimensions as shown in the screenshot and apply the 'colocalize' filter to only include peaks that are found both in red and green. Press ok to find the transformed ROIs in the ROI manager as UUID_short and UUID_long entries.

<div style="text-align: center">
<img align='center' src='{{site.baseurl}}/examples/img/fret/img33.png' width='450'>

<div style="text-align: center">
<img align='center' src='{{site.baseurl}}/examples/img/fret/img7.png' width='450'></div>

**3. Apply the molecule integrator to extract I vs. T traces**  
Now first switch back to the video (instead of the z projection) by clicking on its window. Then, integrate the peaks using the molecule integrator tools developed for dual view microscopy data (Plugins>Mars>Image>Molecule Integrator (dualview)). For channel 0 select to only integrate the peaks in red (long) and in channel 1 integrate the peaks in both colors (both). Press ok and the archive will open automatically upon completion of the calculation. Now the generation of the first archive, the FRET archive, is complete. Repeat the three steps above for both the AO and DO archive with the details as listed below in table 3.

<div style="text-align: center">
<img align='center' src='{{site.baseurl}}/examples/img/fret/img37.png' width='450'>
<img align='center' src='{{site.baseurl}}/examples/img/fret/img38.png' width='450'>

<img align='center' src='{{site.baseurl}}/examples/img/fret/img40.png' width='450'></div>

The molecule integrator automatically names the intensity traces according to the provided channel and wavelength color information. Please reference table 3 for an overview of the corresponding archive names to the intensity parameter names as used in the example.

| Intensity parameter     | Name in Mars     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| I<sub>aemaex</sub>       | "0" (corresponding to C=0, red excitation, red emission)       |
| I<sub>aemdex</sub>       | "1 Red" (corresponding to C=1, green excitation, red emission)       |
| I<sub>demdex</sub>       | "1 Green" (corresponding to C=1, green excitation, green emission)       |

Table 3: Overview of the three different archives that are created in this step of the analysis: the FRET archive, Acceptor Only (AO) archive and Donor Only (DO) archive. The first row of the table shows a representable molecule for the category, the second row explains what information needs to be extracted from this category of molecules, the third row the corresponding parameter names, and the final row describes the analysis procedure that needs to be followed in Mars.
</div>

Change the settings in the previously described tools (peak finder, transform ROIs & molecule integrator) according to the table to generate the AO and DO archives. In summary:

**DO Archive**  
- Peak finder: channel = 1
- Transform ROIs: R->L Affine 2D Matrix (supply  the L->R matrix and activate the 'inverse' button in the dialog), short to long, channel = 0, 'Remove colocalizing ROIs' = True.

**AO Archive**  
- Peak finder: channel = 0
- Transform ROIs: L->R Affine 2D Matrix, long to short, channel = 1, 'Remove colocalizing ROIs' = True.


**Tag and Merge the Archives**  
To make the downstream processing procedure easier the next step is to tag the created archives accordingly and merge them to form one big archive. Use the tag function in the metadata tab to assign the tags 'FRET', 'AO' & 'DO' accordingly and save the archives in the same folder. Next select the merge archives tool (Plugins>Mars>Molecule>Merge Archive) and select the folder. When the command is finished a merged archive is created that can be found in the selected folder. Open the archive.
*Note:* it is very important to save the archive after tagging. Otherwise the tag will not be in the merged archive and errors will be raised in the subsequent analysis steps.

**Plot the Traces to do a Visual Inspection**  
To do a visual inspection of the identified traces open the plot window in the molecules tab and add three line plots representing the three measured intensities (I<sub>aemaex</sub>, I<sub>demdex</sub> & I<sub>aemdex</sub>), if applicable, for each molecule. To do so select the options as shown in the screenshot.

<div style="text-align: center">

#### <a name="4"></a> Data Analysis and Corrections
Please download the [data analysis scripts](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials/tree/master/Example_pipelines/FRET/Follow%20along%20example) from the repository. This will automate all following steps and will eventually generate an archive containing the fully corrected E and S values for each relevant molecule. For a better understanding of the procedure, the parts of the script are discussed in detail below.

**Add the metadata tags to all corresponding molecule records**
For easier record handling, first, run [migrateTagsFromMetadataToMolecules.groovy](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials/blob/master/Example_pipelines/FRET/Follow%20along%20example/migrateTagsFromMetadataToMolecules.groovy) to make migrate all the assigned metadata tags (AO, DO, FRET) to the corresponding molecule records. This makes it easier to look at the data in a later stadium of the analysis.

**Do a position-specific excitation correction accounting for beam profile differences**
For reliable calculations, it is of importance that calculations are not distorted by differences in the beam intensity across the field (beam profile differences) or by differences between donor and acceptor excitation. To account for this, the data is first normalized according to equation 1. In short, the profile-corrected intensity is obtained by multiplying the uncorrected intensity by a normalized ratio between the donor and acceptor of the signal at a certain position. This correction term is calculated using the two calibration images supplied by Hellenkamp et al and correlates the donor and acceptor signal to one another while at the same time correcting for the beam profile of the microscope set-up.

$$\begin{equation}
_ {(profile)}^{i}I_{Aem|Dex} = ^{i}I_{Aem|Dex}* \frac{I_{D}(x',y')}{I_{A}(x,y)}
\end{equation}$$

To do so, open script [ProfileCorrection.groovy](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials/blob/master/Example_pipelines/FRET/Follow%20along%20example/ProfileCorrection.groovy) as well as the two calibration images rr_iMap and og_iMap that were supplied along with the video data from the Zenodo link. Also make sure to have the molecule archive created in the previous steps of this protocol opened. Then run the script. An additional column will be added to the data table for each molecule record where the corrected intensity I<sub>aexaem</sub> will be found named "0_Profile_Corrected".

**Identify the bleaching positions for donor and acceptor**
To identify the bleaching positions for both donor and acceptor in each trace, the single change point finder tool from Mars is applied. After running this tool, the positions of the bleaching events of both dyes will be added to the corresponding molecule record. This information can later on be used to filter molecule traces (make sure each trace has both 1 donor and 1 acceptor) and to do the FRET calculations obtaining E and S values for each molecule.

Start by opening the [findBleachingPositions.groovy](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials/blob/master/Example_pipelines/FRET/Follow%20along%20example/findBleachingPositions.groovy) script from the repository. This script automates the command and makes sure bleaching positions are found for DO, AO and FRET molecules in the colors relevant. Run the script. This will add bleaching positions to the archive shown as markers with dotted lines in the plots.

<<Figure>>

**Selecting the traces to be included in further analysis**
Before proceeding with the following part of automated analysis, it is required to inspect the traces manually and assign the tag 'Accepted' for all molecules fulfilling the requirements:
- There is only 1 donor and only 1 acceptor bleaching step observed in the molecule trace
- Both donor and receptor are present (in the case of FRET-tagged molecules)
- No major deviations or changes in signal intensity are observed that could indicate an artefact
- The fluorescent signal is significantly higher than the noise of the background
- No switching events are observed in the trace

Please go through all molecule plots in the archive and tag the molecules accordingly. For convenience, the [automated tagging feature in the cog tab](https://duderstadt-lab.github.io/mars-docs/docs/MarsRover/Settings/) of the archive might be used. Click on the link for more information on how to use this feature.



**Trace-wise Background Correction**
The first correction that is applied to the dataset is a background correction. In this trace-wise process the mean fluorophore intensity after fluorophore bleaching is considered to be the background signal and is subtracted from the calculated fluorophore intensity. This is done for each intensity measurement (I<sub>aemaex</sub>, I<sub>demdex</sub> & I<sub>aemdex</sub>) separately and in a trace-wise manner. The values of the corrected I parameters are stored in the archive as <sup>ii</sup>I<sub>aemaex</sub>, <sup>ii</sup>I<sub>demdex</sub> & <sup>ii</sup>I<sub>aemdex</sub> respectively.

To do these calculations on the archive, open the script [smFRET_workflow_1_profile_corrected.groovy](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials/blob/master/Example_pipelines/FRET/Follow%20along%20example/smFRET_workflow_1_profile_corrected.groovy) and run in the script editor. All calculated values discussed will be added to the archive.

**Correction for Leakage ($\alpha$) and Direct excitation ($\delta$)**
In this step two data corrections are carried out: a correction for leakage, the process of donor emission in the acceptor detection channel, and a correction for direct excitation, the process of acceptor emission by direct excitation of the acceptor at the donor wavelength. Both lead to signal intensity distortions when uncorrected and would influence the measured FRET parameters. Therefore they are corrected in this part of the analysis procedure. For more information about these correction parameters the reader is referred to literature<sup>[9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0085-0)</sup>.

The leakage ($\alpha$) and direct excitation ($\delta$) correction factors can be calculated using the formulae below. As indicated, these formulae require the calculated fluorescence intensities from the DO and AO populations respectively. Subsequently, they are implemented in the latter three formulae to find the corrected E and S values. The $\alpha$ and $\delta$ correction factors as well as the calculated F<sub>A|D</sub>, <sup>iii</sup>E<sub>app</sub><sup>(DO)</sup>, and <sup>iii</sup>S<sub>app</sub><sup>(AO)</sup> values will appear as parameters in the archive.


$$\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{\langle ^{ii}E_{app}^{(DO)} \rangle}{1 - \langle   ^{ii}E_{app}^{(DO)} \rangle}
    \quad\mathrm{and}\quad
\delta = \frac{\langle ^{ii}S_{app}^{(AO)} \rangle}{1 - \langle ^{ii}S_{app}^{(AO)} \rangle}
\end{equation}$$

$$\begin{equation}
F_{A|D}=^{ii}I_{Aem|Dex} - \alpha ^{ii}I_{Dem|Dex} - \delta ^{ii}I_{Aem|Aex}
\end{equation}$$

$$\begin{equation}  
^{iii}E_{app} = \frac{F_{A|D}}{F_{A|D} + ^{ii}I_{Dem|Dex}}
   \quad\mathrm{and}\quad   
^{iii}S_{app} = \frac{F_{A|D} + ^{ii}I_{Dem|Dex}}{F_{A|D} + ^{ii}I_{Dem|Dex} + ^{ii}I_{Aem|Aex}}
\end{equation}$$

This correction has been done in the previously run script.

**Correction for Excitation ($\beta$) and Detection factors ($\gamma$)**
The last data correction step corrects for excitation ($\beta$), normalizing excitation intensities and cross-sections of both acceptor and donor, and detection factors ($\gamma$), normalizing effective fluorescence quantum yields and detection efficiencies of both donor and acceptor. To find both global correction factors a linear regression analysis is performed with the following formula. To do these calculations, the average E or S value respectively of each molecule is used to prevent unequal weighting of longer traces.


$$\begin{equation}  

^{iii}S_{app}^{(FRET)} = \frac{1}{1 + \gamma * \beta + (1-\gamma)*\beta *^{iii}E_{app}^{(FRET)}}
\end{equation}$$

$$\begin{equation}  
\frac{1}{^{iii}S_{app}^{(FRET)}} = 1 + \gamma* \beta + (1-\gamma)*\beta *^{iii}E_{app}^{(FRET)} = b * ^{iii}E_{app}^{(FRET)} + a

\end{equation}$$

From this equation the dependencies of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ on a and b can be deducted to:


$$\begin{equation}
\beta = a + b - 1
       \quad\mathrm{and}\quad
\gamma = \frac{a - 1}{a + b - 1}
\end{equation}$$

Once the values of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ have been calculated, the fully corrected E and S values can be calculated. To do so, first F<sub>D|D</sub> and F<sub>A|A</sub> are calculated, then added to the archive, followed by the calculation of E and S. Note that these values are extremely sensitive to outliers and will have low significance when used on datasets with a low number of data points.


$$\begin{equation}
F_{D|D} = \gamma * ^{ii}I_{Dem|Dex}
   \quad\mathrm{and}\quad   
F_{A|A} = \frac{1}{\beta} * ^{ii}I_{Aem|Aex}
\end{equation}$$

$$\begin{equation}
E = \frac{F_{A|D}}{F_{D|D} + F_{A|D}}
  \quad\mathrm{and}\quad
S = \frac{F_{A|D} + F_{D|D}}{F_{D|D} + F_{A|D} + F_{A|A}}

\end{equation}$$

To do these calculations on the archive, open the script [smFRET_workflow_2.groovy](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials/blob/master/Example_pipelines/FRET/Follow%20along%20example/smFRET_workflow_2.groovy) and run in the script editior. All calculated values discussed will be added to the archive.

#### <a name="9"></a> Plotting & Data Exploration in Python
To explore the data save the generated archive and open the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials). Set up the connection to your local copy of Fiji as indicated and change the file path to the archive. Please note that running the notebook requires the set-up of a new python environment. Directions to do so can be found in this [tutorial](https://duderstadt-lab.github.io/mars-docs/tutorials/marsto/open-a-Molecule-Archive-in-Python/). After running all cells a plot is obtained showing the fully corrected E and S values for all molecules that matched the selection criteria in this archive.  
_Note that the analysis of a single video from the dataset such as done in this example leads to a low number of data points. This affects the accuracy of the calculated correction factors and E and S values. On top of that, a reliable beta/gamma correction is possible only when the data consists of 2 populations at the minimum. Therefore the reliability of the outcome of this example is compromised. The accuracy can be improved by analyzing all videos supplied in the repository corresponding to this dataset. The outcome of such an analysis is presented in the next paragraph._

<div style="text-align: center">
<img align='center' src='{{site.baseurl}}/examples/img/fret/1-lo_analyzed.png' width='350'></div>

This analysis shows that an average population FRET value of E = 0.28 was obtained from this single dataset. Please note that this value is rather distorted because of the low number of data points and data available for correction. Also, since only one sample is taken into consideration the beta/gamma correction is distorting the results. Therefore it is not a good estimate for the FRET efficiency of the sample. Please continue to the following section for a better estimate considering all available videos.

#### <a name="10"></a> Conclusion: Global Analysis Outcomes and Comparisons to Literature
The described analysis can be repeated for all provided videos for both the 1-lo and 1-mid sample datasets to obtain the E and S values more reliably for both samples. The outcome of such an extensive analysis can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/duderstadt-lab/mars-tutorials) with all accompanying scripts and archives. Please note that in order to analyze all data a specific procedure needs to be followed. Please read the read-me file in the repository with further instructions.

The final plot of this analysis shows that the FRET populations are observed at S= 0.49 and S=0.55 with E-values of E= 0.18 (1-lo) and E= 0.56 (1-mid). This is very close to the expected values as published by Hellenkamp *et al.* <sup>[9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0085-0)</sup> (shown with dashed lines in the plot).

In conclusion, this example Mars workflows showed that Mars is a software platform that is equipped to do a robust, transparent, traceable, and reliable data analysis for FRET experiments. This analysis outcome comparison to the benchmark study by Hellenkamp *et al.* <sup>[9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0085-0)</sup> shows that very similar FRET values are obtained and that therefore Mars is an excellent tool to be used to analyze these type of datasets.

#### <a name="12"></a> Troubleshooting
This section highlights some of the common errors or problems that may occur during following along with the example as well as possible solutions. Please reference the table below in case you encounter any problems during the analysis. If your question has not been answered in this section, please feel free to [reach out](https://forum.image.sc/tag/mars) to our lab by making a forum post.

| Problem Description     | Solution     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Most parameters (E, S, iEapp, iSapp) display NaN values       | This most often happens because some of the metadata tags are missing. Solution: check in the metadata tab if the metadata records are tagged 'FRET', 'AO', and 'DO' respectively. Solution: add the correct tag to the metadata. This problem often arises when the archive has been tagged, but has not been saved, before merging using the 'merge archives' tool.     |
| No datapoints are obtained in the Rover bubble plot       | This indicates that either the plotting script did not run correctly or somewhere during the analysis no data was found or was interpreted wrongly yielding either no E and S values or values that are out of bound. Solution: first check if the plotting script ran correctly. Move to the 'log' tab in the plotting widget (the little book icon). If the script did not run correctly an error is displayed. Solve the error by adjusting the script in the script tab. Common mistakes include copy-paste errors or selection of the wrong language (needs to be Python). If this is not the answer to your problem, check in the archive whether the parameters 'iEapp', 'iSapp', 'E', and 'S' have reasonable values for the molecules that were tagged 'Active_single'. (1) In case NaN values are observed please take a look at the first problem-solution pair in this overview. (2) In case 'weird' values are observed for E and S either one of the correction steps or the peak integration steps are off. Check the parameter values of alpha, beta, gamma, and delta in the metadata parameters tab (should all be between 0 and 2). In case beta and gamma are not within boundaries, try to run script7_fixed instead of the normal script7. Else, verify if the correct settings have been used in the 'peak finder' and 'molecule integrator' tools. Refresh the plot after solving the issue.        |
| No peaks were found by the 'peak finder'       | This might be the  case when the 'peak finder' settings (especially threshold settings) are entered wrongly. Solution: verify that the correct 'peak finder' settings were entered in the dialog and run the analysis again.       |
| The ROI manager is empty after running the 'transform ROIs' tool       | This behavior can be caused by two issues: (1) there were no peaks placed in the ROI manager by the 'peak finder' or (2) the ROI manager was not closed or reset before doing running the transform ROIs tool on a second dataset. Solution: (1) check if the 'peak finder' settings are entered correctly and use the 'preview' option to verify that the tool finds the peaks. Check if the 'Add to ROI manager' option is selected in the menu. (2) close the ROI manager and run the analysis again, starting from the 'peak finder' command.     |
| The archive or script editor freezes during the analysis       | This occasionally happens, especially when Fiji has been active on your computer for a little longer. Solution: close Fiji and retry the analysis after a software restart.       |
| No I vs. T plots are observed after entering the x and y settings in the plotting menu       | Solution: refresh the plot by pressing the refresh button at the bottom right corner of the plot settings menu       |
| No output is generated after running a Mars tool       | Either the input settings were selected in such a way that no output is expected, or the tool encountered an error. Solution: (1) verify the settings of the tool. (2) Check for red printed errors in the Fiji Console window (Window>Console). Either resolve the error by selecting different settings in the Mars tool dialog window or run the tool again.    |
| No changes are made to the Archive after running one of the scripts       | It might be that the script encountered an error and did not run till completion. Solution: open the 'Console' window (Window>Console) in Fiji and see if any red errors are raised. If so, resolve the error and run the script again.       |
